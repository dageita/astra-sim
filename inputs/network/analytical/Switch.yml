# Switch Topology with 64 NPUs
# Each link BW is 50 GB/s (per each direction)
# And each link latency is 500 ns.

# Switch Topology
topology: [ Switch ]  # Ring, Switch, FullyConnected

# 64 NPUs
npus_count: [ 8 ]  # number of NPUs

# Bandwidth per each link (i.e., per each upstream and downstream link)
bandwidth: [ 200.0 ]  # GB/s

# Latency per each link
latency: [ 2000.0 ]  # ns
